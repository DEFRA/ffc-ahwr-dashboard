        This accessibility statement applies to the '{{ serviceName }}' service.
        <br/><br/>
        This service is run by the Rural Payments Agency (RPA). We want as many people as possible to be able to use this service. For example, that means you should be able to:
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>zoom in up to 400% without the text spilling off the screen</li>
          <li>navigate most of the website using just a keyboard </li>
          <li>navigate most of the website using speech recognition software </li>
          <li>listen to most of the website using a screen reader (including the most recent versions of JAWS, NVDA and VoiceOver) </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p class="govuk-body">We’ve also made the text as simple as possible to understand.</p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-s">How accessible this website is</h2>
      <p class="govuk-body">
        We know some parts of the website are not fully accessible:
      </p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>You can’t zoom in up to 400% without some of the content overlapping and losing legibility</li>
        <li>You can’t listen to some of the website using a screen reader (including the most recent versions of JAWS, NVDA and VoiceOver)</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="govuk-body">
        We are working to fix these and aim to have most of these issues resolved by September 2025.
